This project uses a BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) dataset containing 50,000 transactions.
The dataset includes customer demographics, purchase details, and repayment status.

The machine learning problem is a classification task:
The goal is to predict whether a customer will repay their BNPL purchase on time (Repayment_Status).
The model will learn patterns from customer age, income, credit score, purchase amount, gender, purchase category, and BNPL provider.
